## D_N_T

#### serial_com
- This file shows a method in which **Raspberry Pi** and **arduino** are connected via a single wire through which power sharing and all the data transfer occurs.

#### SDA_SCl
- This file talks about the method in which both devices, **Raspberry Pi** and **arduino**, share only communication pins, which are SDA and SCL pins, and both devices are powered using their different power sources.

-  This method was developed because we can only afford to run some of the devices using a single power source. Also, both devices' power requirements differ based on their workability.
